MASSH: MApping Sea Surface Height
===================================
MASSH is a python package designed to perform space-time dynamical interpolation of sparse altimetric data to generate gridded SSH maps. SSH maps are useful for a wide range of applications, such as the tracking of ocean eddies, regional quantification of sea level rise, operational motinotoring of marine environment and 3D reconstuction of the ocean dynamics. 
This package allows running various mapping tools, most of them based on Data Assimilation techniques (e.g. Nudging, 4Dvar) along with simple dynamical models (e.g. Quasi-Geostrophic, Shallow-Water models).
