MASSH: MApping Sea Surface Height
===================================
MASSH is a python package designed to perform space-time dynamical interpolation of sparse altimetric data to generate gridded SSH maps. SSH maps are useful for a wide range of applications, such as the tracking of ocean eddies, regional quantification of sea level rise, operational motinotoring of marine environment and 3D reconstuction of the ocean dynamics.
